# :question: What is this repository?

A website for a _World of Warcraft_ guild called _Currently Unnamed_ on the _Tarren Mill_ server.

It is designed to be a **fully responsive** Single Page Application (**SPA**) which will **lazy load** heavy assets (videos).

This application has been built using _React_ in combination with _Sass_ and automatically deployed via _GitHub Actions_.

# :eyes: Where can I see this website?

As of now it is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://beatadetkova.github.io/currently-unnamed-website/). In the near future the website will be moved to _AWS_ with a custom domain.

# :nerd_face: I am developer, how can I play with your website?

Feel free to [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository on your machine.

You can then run `npm i` and `npm start` in your favorite terminal inside of the freshly cloned repository.

This will start a development server available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (except if the port is already taken, in which case it'll ask for confirmation to ue another one).

The page will reload if you make any edits and also show you any error it may have encountered while running/building.
